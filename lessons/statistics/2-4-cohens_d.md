[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

Using the variable `totalwgt_lb`, investigate whether first babies are lighter or heavier than others.

Compute Cohenâ€™s effect size to quantify the difference between the groups. How does it compare to the difference in pregnancy length?

    mean = live.totalwgt_lb.mean()
    var = live.totalwgt_lb.var()
    std = live.totalwgt_lb.std()
    
    print('mean: {}, var: {}, std: {}'.format(mean, var, std))
    print('firstborn totalwgt_lb mean: {} lbs, other totalwgt_lb mean: {} lbs'.format(firsts.totalwgt_lb.mean(), others.totalwgt_lb.mean()))
    print("Difference in lbs: {} lbs".format(firsts.totalwgt_lb.mean() - others.totalwgt_lb.mean()))
    
    firsts.totalwgt_lb.mean() - others.totalwgt_lb.mean()

mean: 7.265628457623368, var: 1.9832904288326532, std: 1.4082934455690168
firstborn totalwgt_lb mean: 7.201094430437772 lbs, other totalwgt_lb mean: 7.325855614973262 lbs  
Difference in lbs: -0.12476118453549034 lbs

### First babies are slightly (0.125lbs) lighter

    difference = CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb, others.totalwgt_lb) 
    print("difference: {}".format(difference))
difference: -0.088672927072602

Compared with difference in pregnancy length between first babies and others:

    CohenEffectSize(firsts.prglngth, others.prglngth)
    
0.028879044654449883

The Cohen Effect Size for the difference between the weight of first babies and others is -3.07x the Cohen Effect Size for the difference between pregnancy lengths for first babies and others (-0.088672927072602 / 0.028879044654449883 = -3.070493783)
