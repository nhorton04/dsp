[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

**Exercise:** The numbers generated by `numpy.random.random` are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.
Generate 1000 numbers from `numpy.random.random` and plot their PMF.  What goes wrong?
Now plot the CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

    t = np.random.random(1000)
    pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(t)
    thinkplot.Pmf(pmf, linewidth=0.1)
    thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random variate', ylabel='PMF')

    cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(t)
    thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
    thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random variate', ylabel='CDF')

    ## Yes, the distribution is uniform.
